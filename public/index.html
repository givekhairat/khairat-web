			<h2>Story</h2>
			<img src="/assets/img/story.svg">
			<p>When I was 16, I missed an opportunity to feed a hungry person out of sheer ignorance and stupidity. I was traveling to another country where the event happened. They couldn't ask me because we didn't speak the same language, and they had money in their hand leading me to believe they didn't need help. It was only after I got my food and left the place when I realised they didn't have enough money.</p>
			<p>Years after the event, the shame still lingers, but now it's turned into a tremendous desire to help people in need, especially if they're hungry. Nobody should ever have to go hungry. A few years ago, I had an opportunity to feed another person. I nearly missed it, but was able to salvage at the last moment. The joy I got from helping someone was tremendous. Which is why I'm building Khairat.</p>
			<p>Khairat means charity in Urdu. It's a platform where you can donate something and know exactly where it went. It brings transparency to every step and gives you real time notifications when your donations are put to use.</p>
